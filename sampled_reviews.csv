And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

I started Zuke's Hip Action  a little over 2 weeks ago. Yesterday for the first time in months she came upstairs during the day while I work in my office. And today she jumped on the chaise for a nap.  I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

It has no diet after taste as with most artificially sweetened sodas. Anyway the people who downward this are missing the point that this is NOT using poison to sweeten it. Stevia is natural. I have extremely sensitive taste buds and a sophisticated pallet and I can tell you that there's not much of a difference in flavor between say Sucralose(which is awful for you) and Stevia which is 100% safe.<br />So if u want to trash this and keep feeding you and your kids garbage and poison by all means. Google what artificial sweeteners do to the immune system. I used to be good for three colds per year and two sinus infections per year. Since eliminating all artificial sweeteners(from drinks gums candies etc they sneak it in everything now. Start reading labels) I have not been sick ONCE in 4 Yeats since eliminating it. So I'll stick to Blue sky when I choose to have a soda. It's delicious.

They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.

It is pricey but if you are able to taste the difference in water taste this will put a smile on your face and a smile from your body as you drink it. Volvic comes from france with a perfect balance of mineral flavors. I have difficulty drinking straight water as most bottled water has no taste and is just wet like poland spring. I can drink volumes of volvic water easily due to the great refreshing taste. I cannot do that with tasteless water like poland spring and fiji waters. Fiji is also expensive but it is just a fancy bottle with tasteless water. Cost does not guarantee quality taste. If you have never experienced the taste of a good water you will if you try this. Always chill volvic for best results before drinking in the bottle it came in. Addition of ice not originated from volvic may alter the taste. The flavor of good water comes from the mineral content and volvic has a perfect blend. Enjoy<br />P.s. You can find it cheaper at whole foods

On its own I think its just ok but it does make a great base when you add additional lentils and kidney beans it also increases the serving size substantially and makes it worth the price. I saute a 1/4 cup of chopped red onion with 1 chopped garlic clove and 1 tablespoon of olive oil until the onion is tender.  Then I add 2 cups of water and bring it to a boil. I reduce the heat and add a pinch of salt and 3/4 cup of French lentils. Cook the lentils until just tender and stir in 1 can of drained kidney beans plus 1 Tbsp  butter and the contents of the package. Heat thoroughly.  You can add vegetable broth or water to adjust the consistency. Tastes great as a soup or side dish and is great with salmon and adds some variety to my meals.

Since there were no reviews on this pasta I took a leap of faith.  Having had the pasta a few times now I am excited to say that this is an excellent product and is worth purchasing at Amazon.  I am now inclined to try the other pasta's from the same brand.  I have tried it with both salt added and no salt added to the water and they turn out great both ways.  It depends on how you plan to cook the sauce I guess but the pasta itself is versatile and very easy to cook.  Just follow the instructions. I used a large 12qt pasta pot to make it and it worked out great.

He likes it and he is losing weight. He is overweight and I have tried different things to knock off the weight. This is actually working. So it must be the no grain recipe. People need grain-Dogs don't. Acts like carbs in their system. I've also been feeding him the Natural Balance Alpha dry dog food.No grain in it either. He likes the taste even without mixing it with wet food. I may go straight dry food if this keeps up. So-I am happy with the dog food and with Amazon's prices. Also the shipping was free with a faster shipping time for some reason. Thanks Amazon.

This is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over. It is a feeling you do not forget.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it.<br /><br />  For those who enjoy drinking tea I would encourage you to look into the 'Breville' tea maker. Produced by a German firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea. The price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny.

There are 5 bars to a box and it comes out to around $14/box which is a bit expensive (I deducted a star for value) but peanuts are the first ingredient.  I would rather pay more money for these then have my kids (and myself) eat a peanut bar where peanuts are listed as the third or fourth ingredient.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the health snack bars and this one is a good substitute for me.  It's not exactly a diet snack but it's better then the other options I usually go to when I am feeling peckish.

I always liked thick shakes growing up so I thought it might be a way to make a sensible shake or smoothie with the body of a more indulgent drink. Guess what  -  it's amazing! It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling. Home made ice cream is another natural. Try it and discover your own uses.

I tried this tea to see if it would be a nice one to add to my rotation (I like Paradise Iced Tea and China Mist Mango & Passion Fruit ice teas). It was so horrible tasting I couldn't drink it. It doesn't taste like Mango at all - it tastes vaguely of herbal hibiscus and rose - it doesn't taste fruity at all.<br /><br />I plan to give it away to someone who likes herbal teas -- because I'm quite certain it lacks any black tea (or any tea at all?)..and therefore wouldn't be useful to me (I like caffeine in my tea).

The senseo is sooooo much better than Keurig (I have been in situations where it was the only thing available. It just isn't as good). I hate that Senseo makers and pods aren't in our US markets anymore. If you love senseo like I do adn love your coffee maker this coffee is a good fit. I hope Baronet keeps providing these.

I have used almost every type of real vanilla over the years and none is better than this one.  The taste fits my needs perfectly and those who eat the end result agree.  Even though cheap imitation vanilla is readily available at a low cost per unit and other real vanilla is also readily available this one is the absolute best.  I thought that the 32 ounce size would be too much and it might not get used before expiring but I was just plain wrong.  It will be gone long before its expiration and all the consumers in this house will say thank you.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as having one of the church ladies or a guest extolling the goodness of a pound cake made with Nielsen's.  I know the vanilla is just an insignificant part of the total product but it is the one element that adds so much to the flavor and goodness.

The package came today.  I opened it up and had a few nuts.  they were chewy and smelled a bit off- both signs of staleness.  I checked the expiration date: 6/17/2012... It didn't make sense.  so I had a few more and wondered how I could make them palatable.  Eventually I came across some forums that said that staleness in nuts was the result of the oil turning rancid and hence is non-reversible.  Not to be defeated by something i bought to save money I did some more digging and found a forum that said that if you heat nuts at 350 for 10 minutes you can bring some life back into them.  I tried it and they came out burnt.  Tried again for 5 minutes instead of 10 and it worked.  They weren't perfect but they were crunchy and palatable which was a step up.  I give these 2 stars instead of 1 since they can be partially salvaged.  Too bad Amazon doesn't take returns on food.<br /><br />edit:<br />I just threw up.  I'm throwing these out and changing the review to one star.  Don't buy these if you value your GI tract.

He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.
181715,B001J9QBU4,A1Q7K2TXDK0PJB,El Officianado,4,4,5,1292112000,The Best in the Pack,I recently purchased the Keurig B-60 Special Edition Brewer from Amazon.  It came with a sample variety pack of 12 different K-cup blends (note no light blends included).  I tried all of them and found this particular blend to be the best to my liking although I do prefer a light blend.  It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.  It is a medium blend and tastes relatively smooth without an excessively strong or acidic aftertaste.  Recommend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer a  medium blend coffee.  I recently found the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend available at my local Walmart and plan to write a review on it.

Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not. I like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than Switch. Not such a great product in my opinion.

This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

Each cookie is sealed in it own pouch so when you open it up it is fresh.  They come 6 packs to the box.  If you need fiber in your diet you can get 4 g per cookie.  You also get 180 calories per cookie.  While the label on the box states that the cookies are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats (and they are) they are also made with wheat.  If you read down the ingredients they also contain soy bean oil.  While this is not important to most people it is to any allergic or sensitive to either ingredients. These would be great to keep in the car for a quick snack or to put in a lunch box for children to take to school.

As most others have pointed out this is not a true K-cup as the base in not plastic. These make a nice strength of coffee for your medium cup size. It is a little weak coffee for me on the larger size. They come in three bags and I do wish that they could be resealed but I solved the problem by placing them in an air tight container. When I opened the bag of coffee I was hit by the smell of fresh ground coffee. I hadn't realized how much I have missed that smell. You don't get that with the plastic cups. Over all I thought it was a good price and makes a nice cup of coffee. I will be keeping my subscription.

I purchased a My K-cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was I going to do about the tea? I tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat. Next I tried using this tea and it worked perfect (but a word of caution...remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier). No more brewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to brew and it tastes great!!! Not weak and off taste but perfect.

168187,B005VOOKS8,A100WO06OQR8BQ,"""Duffer. """"Bo""""""",0,1,2,1332201600,Not A Winner,A box of this coffee contains 15 packets. There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted. It would take all 15 packets to make  one 8 cup pot of weak coffee at a cost of over ten bucks. Not a good choice. There are far better coffees available at far more reasonable prices. They would be a much better choice than this Marley.

Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say """"wow what smells so delicious?"""". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!"""

This is not really a problem since the fat is from nuts which is the good kind of fat.  The bar is a bit dryer than most other ones I've tried so I like to have a drink on standby near me when I eat one.

There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted.

Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!

Coconut oil is suppose to clear cobwebs out of your brain helps clear away brain fog and attacks and reverses Alzheimer's disease . Virgin coconut oil cleans your liver and does wonders for your intestines and digestive tract. I wont be buying a moisturizer nor body lotion or hand cream. I am going to throw all my bottles of chemical filled oils out. I took some oil out of the container and placed it in a jar. I use it all over my body. If you want something a bit more add some shea butter and mix together. You can use it on your lips and hair. I am pleased with my purchase and took the time to let others know that this was a good purchase for me.

I walked into the house this evening and he started raving about this coffee.  I was told that it is full bodied yet very smooth.  There is a slight astringency that adds a kick to the coffee.<br /><br />They aren't actually in cups but rather little bags with a hard top.  And it comes in 3 bags of 12 rather then in a box.  I can appreciate this fact especially since the savings is passed on to me the customer.  Now if only they would also make an iced tea.

Being a tea drinker I inquired about good english teas and they gave me a napkin with the names of bewleys tea on it and about 6 teabags for me to try. I put the napkin in my back pocket and the teabags got wrapped up in an old sandwich bag and put in my wife's purse. We parted with the nice english couple and as we traveled around disneyworld it began to rain that afternoon and we got soaking wet. I found what was left of the napkin that evening at the hotel and it was unreadable. About 6 months later at home the bag fell out of my tea closet as i was fixing to make a cup and I decided to finally try the tea those nice folks from england raved about. I loved the tea and I believe I have finally found it in bewleys. Some of the best tea I have had. The english surely know their tea.

They absolutely love it. They eat it first then they go to their ground patties and meaty bones. I go with the 6-Fish because it is a 70/30 protein ratio and I don't feed my pups veggies except for the daily apple they have. Or pears in the summer from our pear tree. So it's great to have that 30% of fruits and veggies. There are other combinations that are 80/20 for people looking for more protein. I also choose the fish because it eliminates me having to supplement their food with fish oil everyday which for some reason they don't like that much.

I bought a 7 oz. bag of 30 flavors from Target and I find that bag to be too much for me but I would have bought the full 50 flavor assortment if Target had sold it because of the organization and identification of flavors.  I wasn't supposed to get cantaloup in my 30 flavor bag but I did get one and that flavor was so much better than tangerine.  I also liked the root beer.  The popcorn flavor was interestingly reminiscent of artificially fragrant movie theatre popcorn.  The jelly belly flavors are interesting but I prefer the lightly flavored pastel jelly beans available during Easter.  I believe they are manufacturered by Brachs.  They are gentler tasting than jelly bellies.

The fact that it is made with brown rice also makes it more rich in fiber than the white rice pastas.<br /><br />It does take a long time to cook - between 15 to 16 minutes -but it is well worth the wait.<br /><br />I have also served this with red sauce and they do fine there too. The pasta does not get mushy or have any strange flavors when it cools (we had a real issue with that when we tried Quinoa pasta). Definitely worth a try if you cannot eat gluten.

The greeks used barley water mix for their soliders in anient times and the Vitamins and minerals make it a health food.  It is alkaline - it will help settle your acid reflux.  My wife has had on and off acid reflux and recently had to go to the ER over acid reflux.  They could do nothing.  I started her on Barley water - made form boiled Barley.  The only thin added was Truvia because she is a sweet tooth. Every thing must taste sweet for her. It worked.  Last week she made me call the ambulance to the ER.  I knew this was part real and part diet and part getting over emotional panic! Of couse they could not find anything. My moter had a great doctor in New Jersey who to say you could solve most health problems by examing every thing that you did and the food that in your mouth. Stop drinking carbonated water and drink Barley water first thing in the morning and when you have a problem. The barley water got me off diet soda which makes gain weight by stimulating your insulin production by 10 more times the normal. Spenda is 10 to 12 times sweeter than sugar. MY wife's Gerd is much better.<br />She now uswe our juicer to add fresh apple juice(replacing the Truva) to the barley water and natural raw honey both are alkaline.  No more GERD or acid reflux.

The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

A winery told me they leave bottles corked for a week or two at room temp.  Then you can put them away in the fridge.  I have not tried this because they tell you to throw the cap away since your bottle will explode.  I capped it for the fridge and nothing happened.  the fiz of fermentation is stopped after the third day almost anyway so I might try that.

They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.

They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.

After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.

The first time I had this I really wasn't impressed but because I wanted more protein in my meal I added a can of clams which I didn't properly drain.  It was watery and barely edible.  Yesterday I decided that I had the cans yet to use so I opened a can just to get rid of it and after dumping the soup into the sausepan I could see that the consistency was wonderfully creamy with lots of potatoes and enough clams to be able to call it clam chowder.  I apologize to anyone who read my first review and chose not to purchase this wonderful soup.  I had a serving of this soup for lunch today.  I am on a 1200 (plus or minue) calories a day and I have made a commitment to stay this course for a year.

The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

33167,B000SATIZA,A3I3WHXIM1F4C0,bread baker,3,3,5,1323648000,hibiscus tea,I use about 5 rounded tbs per one gallon. We use quite a bit of the tea. If you make it in bulk it can be drunk cold or reheated. I boil a gallon of water place the 5 tbs in the pot and turn off the burner. It will continue to boil for a few minutes. I have let it set as long as over night. Remember that this is not black tea - it will not get bitter if you steep it too long. The nice thing about the hibiscus tea is that it really doesn't need refrigeration. Just make sure that you boil it for a couple of minutes to sterilize the brew. By the way I am very cautious about the fantastic claims of many herbal poducts. I can say with some certainty that hibiscus tea does indeed lower blood pressure.

It's so much easier to carry on walks than a bag full of chopped hot dogs or dog treats.  Plus licking has been shown to have a calming effect on dogs which could make this product helpful for reactive dogs.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and there are no """"iffy"""" ingredients.  To top it off my picky raw fed dogs love this stuff.  I'm keeping it as a training treat only to keep it special for them.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan on buying lots more!<br /><br />ETA:  I would caution against using this with totally unruly dogs.  If you think your dog would rip it out of your hand and chew it up enough to dislodge the ball I would not use this product as the ball *could* be a choking hazard.  I have pit bulls and they could tear this container apart in 2 seconds flat but they are well trained so I know they wouldn't. I would also caution against leaving it laying around where an unsupervised dog could get at it for the same reason.  But I think the benefits to this product far outweigh the potential dangers as long as your careful about it."""

62863,B004OV6X6Q,A3MKPAIK06U60K,Library Girl Reads,0,0,4,1313539200,Vegan Chocolate Treat,I really like that these Pure Natural Bars are vegan and gluten free.  They have a good chocolate flavor and seven grams of protein.<br /><br />I'm currently pregnant and need to take snacks with me to keep my blood sugar steady and these work great for throwing in my purse.  They wouldn't hold up well in the car right now though with the heat we've been having.  The box that I received was a bit banged up and it was clear that some of the bars had melted a bit in transit.<br /><br />The only negative for me is the texture wasn't quite what I was expecting.  I thought the bars would have a candy bar type texture or maybe even a granola bar type texture but these are a bit more like a brownie bar.  I'm not crazy about the texture but overall these are a good snack to have on hand.

They have a very sweet taste and bits of fruit that will remind you of the original fig newtons.  I liked the crunchy texture of the cookies which reminded me of Honey Graham crackers.<br /><br />Each serving of 3 has about 140 calories and contains about 2 g of fiber and 5 g of fat.  To get the fiber in there the cookies are a little dry and I had a glass of milk when eating them.  They are quite good dunked.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed them and will probably buy them again.  One note I seem to have eaten them all myself as none of my children cared for them.  I suppose it is more of an adult taste.

I would not order again -<br /><br />BTW - I don't think syrup s/b left in these plastic containers - I suggest moving them to glass asap.  I notice my other one picked up the taste of the plastic (I gave the Brown Family away so I did not have it that long).

Upon brewing my first cup I noticed that the aroma intensified a bit and had more of a coffee overtone and less of the previous hazelnut and caramel..  Unfortunately the taste was a bit strong and bitter.  It was almost like having strong dark bitter coffee with some hazelnut coffeemate to tone it down.  The second cup was made by brewing a bit lighter and the taste became much more smooth and pleasant.  There is still a slightly bitter undertone but a little bit of milk smooths things out very nicely.  Overall this is a strong and bitter coffee with a hazelnut flavor so make sure this suits your taste or you like your coffee with dash of milk.<br /><br />*** Positive Points: ***<br /><br />- Great hazelnut aroma<br />- Pleasant taste once adjusted for bitterness<br /><br />*** Negative Points: ***<br /><br />- Strong and somewhat bitter taste<br />- Rather expensive

Plumley """"Cookie Monster""""""",0,0,5,1238716800,Cookie + soy/rice milk = delicious,I was diagnosed with severe gluten and egg allergies roughly a year ago and had a hard time parting with my favorite kind of baked good: cookies. I never ate many in the first place but they were a treat or desert and I was thrilled to find a lemon cookie that satisfied my desire for baked goods.<br /><br />The consistency can be off-putting at first but the longer I go without wheat or gluten products the less important the consistency because I have almost forgotten what a real cookie tastes like. These lemon cookies are not tart but have a very nice lemony flavor that is reminiscent of a lemon bar. They are heavy and thick like a dense cake or brownie and incredibly chewy and fresh tasting.<br /><br />I would usually freeze these for a couple hours before taking one to school with me to have between classes. If you're able to drink soy or rice milk then a glass of vanilla or plain flavored milk will go great with these!

The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.

After installing all long the fence (500 ft) I took the dogs to the corner where there was a hole where they used to easily get out. One dog got a shock and jumped away. I do not know if the other dog got shocked.  Then both dogs went all along the fence and looked for a place where were was no wire but there was none. So far they have not gotten out.  I intend to turn off the electricity after a couple of weeks to see if it still works.  Now I am going to set up wire around my garden. Very easy to install. I used black clips to hold it out from the chain link fence and handles to open at the gates. I unplug it when I go out and the dogs are in the house.

The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.

He loves them. the one stick I gave him he is still working on but loves it. IT doesnt make a mess and it doesnt get icky and wet. THey more like carve shavings off with their teeth.

But I've bought this brand for a dollar at my local dollar store and it tastes almost identical to equal. No it wasn't equal but if you look the same ingredients in this is the same as in equal. This price comes to a penny a pack. Which is amazing considering I was paying 1 dollar for fifty. As for as the product in the box. Not a one was out of place or damaged. Took the whole box of packets out and dumped them on the kitchen table to make sure. And not one small grain of the Sweetner was present. Packages was all sealed and put neatly in the box. I  however do suggest that you save a smaller box or bowl to place maybe fifty in bc this box is fairly large to be sitting on the counter or table.  Just keep in a dry place and it should last you a good long while. This product was made for my Lipton sweet tea. Thanks a million seller. Don't be affraid to order this product. You will not be disappointed. I'm ready to order another box and haven't even used one packet out of the box I just received. Hope this helps anyone. Oh one more thing. If your really really really picky don't bother with off brands such as this. You will never be happy. Even though to the less picky it tastes just like equal. Please know one take offense to that. You know your tastes . I sure don't. Some are easy to please . Others are hard. Either way it's surely your choice.  Again don't hesitate to give it a try. If you just try it at your local dollar store. Then if you like it come here to buy from this seller. Oh one more thing you may wonder. No I don't own a business to use this it. It will be totally used in my kitchen for sweet tea and doing a little of sugar free baking considering I'm a diabetic. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps everyone.

Especially for those meals where my will power fails and my family is dying to eat out and I eat a little less than as healthy as I want. Usually I would put a little bit of weight back on after those episodes but with the coconut oil the fat doesn't hang out in my body and my weight stays the same. Also my hair looks and feels wonderful and my skin is softer. I take two with lunch and two with dinner rather than four at once also. Great product!

Some green tea is overly bitter and trying to drink it everyday gets to be a chore rather than a pleasure. But not this Bigelow tea. There is a perfect balance of the tea and peach flavor and it is easier on the stomach because the green tea flavor is fresh and delicate rather than astringent and overbearing. Bigelow has good quality control because every cup is equally yummy and there are no grassy or fishy flavors some other manufacturers' teas have. You can be confident that this is high quality tea and very enjoyable. Drink it by the case as I do...it tastes great and it is good for you to boot!

When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day. Just give it a try-some of you will not like it-but some of you will find it to be an excellent and reasonably priced supplement to those very expensive k-cups that we all love.

It is very stubborn and likes to form chunks.  The taste is weird and texture is like drinking wet sand.<br /><br />The energy boost was enough to drive me into several weeks of experimentation.  My best advice is to put this into a smoothie or milkshake of some sort.  It will be a gritty smoothie but still better than attempting to drink it in water or milk.  I have also baked it into cookies which worked out really well.  Strangely enough it levels off the initial sugar rush you'd get from the cookies and you don't experience a crash afterwards.<br /><br />It is interesting stuff to experiment with for sure.  I'll definitely keep using it for quick meals.

It enables the bread to reach its fullness and the taste won't change because of the gluten. Suggest to use a bit more gluten to the flour when you make the dough. The ratio I use is: 1/2 cup of gluten per 3-cup of all-purpose or whole-wheat flour. An increasement of 1/8 cup of water to the dry ingredients is recommended.

These are a good size treat and being hard and crunchy help keep dogs occupied and also help with breath and teeth. For dogs with sensitive digestion these are gluten free and are made with high protein grain. For human noses these have a slight smell that is not overpowering.<br /><br />We have three dogs with the smallest being around 50-55 pounds. Our puppy is around 65-70 and our biggest around 90 pounds. All three enjoyed the treat stick. Obviously these are all big dogs so I can't speak for small dogs but when all of ours enjoy them I can recommend these to all big dog owners.

So often they are sold out of it and for good reason.  Others must love it as much as I do!!  Try it you'll love it :)

They quit playing with their other toys and carry these around with them.  I have 2 of the x-small and 1 of the med/large which is really big.  Some of them have a rope and some have a rubber rope.  It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.  I have 2 German Shepherds so they are pretty tough on toys.  I also like the fact that you can fill these up ahead of time and then give to dogs later when you are leaving.

The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.

UPDATED 2012!!!,Once upon a time this was such a wonderful product.<br /><br />The old Chocolate Twizzlers were much stronger in many ways. Taste yes and also in product 'behavior'.... The old product was 'tough' to pull apart... it actually had a 'snap' to it... This new 'stuff' behaves more like play-dough -- really 'squishy' and not in a good way. :)<br /><br />All I want to know is who is responsible for such a blunder and have they been fired yet? (kidding / well sorta)<br /><br />Dave<br /><br />Okay... I can't believe they (may have) actually listened!  I got a letter from Nestle back in Dec 2011 that they've reversed their changes to this great product and to look for new packages that have the tag line NOW WITH THE CLASSIC TWIST...  Well being in the middle of a home sale / purchase and all that goes along with that ... Chocolate Twizzlers weren't at the top of my priority... However now I'm going out to find a bag with the new tag line and I'll report back ASAP.  With any luck this 1 star review will be reissued as a 5 star. ... Fingers crossed.

The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip"""

After doing a little research I've found that this is a good quality dog food.  And it's specifically engineered for German Shepherds which have notoriously sensitive stomachs. I've tried other foods and with this one my dogs coat looks a lot healthier and he has more energy. It also lasts longer than a #40 bag of the cheap dog food since he doesn't have to eat as much to get full. I used to get this food at Petsmart but I have to drive 40 min either east or west from where I live to get to a Petsmart so I found it to be incredibly convenient to be able to order on Amazon. I still buy it at Petsmart but I don't have to make special trip just for dog food anymore. And with Amazon Prime I can get it shipped for free and it only cost about $3 more than at Petsmart but it cost more than that in gas to drive there. I've bought this here several times and will continue to buy it here since it's so convenient.

I have enjoyed these pecan pies for years and they only keep getting better.  The gooey filling is nicely contrasted to any fried food that my family likes.<br /><br />It is recommended to place the pie on the dashboard of your truck for 60-90 minutes prior to eating.  The heat from the sun really warms up the goo/pecan mixture.<br /><br />Don't try to eat the pie while talking on your CB.  I got goo all in my mic and had to order another one for $45 and then pay $50 to get it tuned.<br /><br />Be sure to save the pie tins.  I take mine home to the old lady to wash.  I have some nailed to my mail box pole and they serve as great reflectors.  I also use them to store screws/bolts/nails etc. on my work bench.  My old lady once made a mobile out of them and put over Bobby's crib when he was a baby.  They make great ash trays and they can also be hung from trees to keep the deer out of your yard/garden.

I sometimes do not feel like brewing a whole pot. I especially love the decaf version for later at night when I want a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Buying the 50 count does work out cheaper than the grocery store or Starbucks retail stores per packet.

It tastes even better."""" """"Did you change the recipe? I liked it before but this is even better."""" To me it really brings out a richer more complex flavor out of all the ingredients its combined with. At this point I'm out of zucchini and the bottle is almost empty too.<br /><br />Next time I will go for the 32oz bottle as its much cheaper by the ounce.<br /><a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GE8N4Y"""">Nielsen-Massey 32 oz.

I have to give my dog medicine on a daily basis and he takes them like treats using pill pockets. I normally buy the capsule (as opposed to tablet) size and just pull off as much as I need to cover the size pill Dexter has to take. This makes the product last longer. Dexter thinks they're a treat and just gobbles it down medicine and all.<br /><br />The one draw back for me is the smell of the Allergy formula pockets - it's pretty bad! I've used the beef flavor in the past and don't remember the smell being so bad. I had to stop using the beef formulas because after finally reading the ingredients I found it had chicken broth/stock in it and my dog is allergic to chicken. Not sure why they put chicken of any kind in a beef version but I've found this in many beef products.

The cost of shipping might be a bit high for this small bag; but buy it anyway.  I sprinkle it on the scratching post and my cats trim their nails and get a treat at the same time.

71123,B002PI82P0,ALTR89MZ6IM8T,I. Pelofsky,13,13,4,1272931200,Saeco Vienna Plus Expresso Machine,Easy to use machine that works well making espresso or just an single cup of coffee. The only complaint I have is if you are using a large cup for regular coffee you have to angle putting in and removing the cup since the bottom of the drip spouts are not high enough even when adjusting the pull-down or push-up spout that is provided. This is a well priced unit for what it provides you. You can adjust the grind of the beans but it comes manufacturer set for a medium grind. It comes with lights that once turn solid green let you know that you are ready to use whatever function you choose and dial for adjusting espresso to a full cup of coffee is clearly marked and easy to read. Steam is provided when pressing the 3rd button on - when it is off you get very hot water dispensed. The area for grinding the beans handles a lot so if you like switching types of coffee then you have to keep only the amount for what you are using in the grinder since there is no way of easily switching coffee beans once the container is full. Overall I would recommend it for anyone who likes to prepare their own coffee because of it's price and ease of use.

For this reason I take the entire trash can to the the outside bin and dump which almost defeats their purpose?!They are indeed entirely biodegradable-no bits of plastic remaining hence the corn cob on the label as clue to the consumer.

Without exception everyone I served this too has loved it and asked for the name to purchase for themselves. It is full flavored but not dark and it has a very smooth taste with no bitterness (this is important to me..I find many K-cups to have a bitter aftertaste that affects the aroma of the coffee as well). A normal adding of cream and sugar works fine as well - you don't need more or less than your usual (again helpful when you are making it for clients and such).<br /><br />This is THE favorite for my office and one we will continue to purchase.

She won't eat any small food anymore (I have tried some samples) and actually eats all the Science Diet and leaves the small ones for me to discard.  It's a bit pricey but I would recommend it.

It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.

Ross,3,3,4,1264377600,Better than the Buster Cube; almost as good as a bully stick,"""We bought the """"small"""" toy with the rubber rope for our 19 lb mutt who gets very whiny when he's bored. I must say it's the best treat dispensing toy we've given him. It's way less noisy than the Buster Cube and the same amount of treats/kibble lasts longer. Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1/4 cup of kibble in the tug-a-jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.<br /><br />I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the """"rope"""" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.<br /><br />The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day. Alternating them with the tug-a-jug has given us some peace and quiet. Altogether a good investment in our situation."""

I will know in a few months what my vet thinks.  But just looking at his teeth for an 8 year old dog they look pretty darn good.  The only down side is the sizes of the chews are not consistant.  Some are big and thick some small and very thin.  I purchased the large dog chews and many were just bite size.  This next bag is for X-tra large dogs hopefully it will have more unformed sized chews.

I am used to using green tea that comes in the tea bags and drink several cups per day so I was excited to see if I would like these. I just opened one and drank a little bit and the first thought that came to mind is rancid. I don't know whether I got a bad batch or not but it tastes nothing like I thought it would. I thought I would get a light tasting traditional green tea but instead took in a mouthful of funky tasting fermented-like liquid. It even smells bad. I somehow will have to stomach power my way through 11 more of these. I don't know if I have the stomach for it....

They expect a sachet of powder  to be the basis of their nutrition regimen.<br /><br />I first experienced EBOOST when flying on Virgin America a while back. This product is available from the in-flight menu. I tried it a couple of times and found it to be a sweet pick-me-up. Did it have a health benefit? Maybe. It can't hurt to get the extra vitamins listed on the packet can it?<br />I take a range of supplements and while EBOOST is not as comprehensive as some others it does contain a decent amount of vitamins.<br /><br />I like the convenient sachets - I keep one or two in my carry bag and then shake it up in a bottle of water when I want a sweet taste. The taste reminds me a bit of Tang I used to have as a kid.<br /><br />I like this product - but please don't think it is the key to good health...
